				<p>The New York Mets have won two World Series in their lifetime.  The first one
				was in 1969 and the second was in 1986.  In 1986, the Mets came back from a 2-0 series deficit.</p><br/>
				<p>In 1969, the Mets beat the Baltimore Orioles.  This is still considered one of the biggest upsets in World Series history.  
				This earned them the nickname, the "Miracle Mets".</p><br/>
				<p>In 1986, they beat the Boston Red Sox.  Game 6 of this series had an unbelievable finish
				as the Mets' Mookie Wilson hit the ball down the first base line and it went through the legs the Red Sox's Bill Buckner.
				Ray Knight scored from second on this play and the Mets' won in the bottom of the 10th inning.  Shea Stadium was as loud as it could be
				because the Mets' had forced a game 7 in a series they were down 2-0.</p><br/>
				<p>The Mets have lost three World Series as well.  They lost in seven games in 1973 to the
				Oakland Athletics.  They lost in a subway series to the Yankees in 2000, and a five game series
				loss to the Kansas City Royals in 2015.</p><br/>
				<p>In 1973, the Mets barely won the division to make the playoffs.  They went on to beat the Cincinnati Red in the
				National League Championship Series three games to two.  In 2000, the Mets played the Yankees in the first postseason Subway Series
				since 1956.  This also marked the third consecutive World Series for the Yankees.  In 2015, the Mets came back in the regular season and
				pulled away with the division title.  After defeating the Dodgers in a five game series thanks to the heroics of Daniel Murphy, they went on
				to face the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS.  The Mets defeated them in only four games.  Sadly, they went into the World Series against a tough
				Royals team and lost in five games.</p>
