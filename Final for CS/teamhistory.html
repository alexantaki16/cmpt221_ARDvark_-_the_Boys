			<div class = "background2">
				<p>The New York Mets have a rich history filled with many achievements.
				The team recorded its first no-hitter courtesy of Johan Santana on June 1, 2012.</p><br/>
				<p>On April 13, 2009, the New York Mets started their first inaugural season at Citi Field in Flushing, Queens.</p><br/>
				<p>The New York Mets hold the record for the worst single season record in the Modern Era, which is from 1900 to the present day.
				  The team's record was 40 and 120.</p><br/>
				<p>On the other hand, the Mets have also won 100 games or more three times in their lifetime.  The first two times
				they won 100 games or more they went on to win the World Series.</p><br/>
				<p>The Mets have also made a few amazing trades.  They traded for Keith Hernandez in 1983, Mike Piazza in 1998, Noah Syndergaard
				in 2012, and lastly Yoenis Cespedes in 2015.  These trades were great for the Mets because they all worked out in the their favor.
				Keith Hernandez was a tremendous leader with a powerful bat and consistent glove.  Mike Piazza, a Hall of Famer, is greatest hitting catcher
				in the history of the MLB.  Noah Syndergaard is one of the best pitchers in the league right now and hes is only 24.  Lastly, Yoenis Cespedes
				is one of the best hitters in the game and comes in clutch when they need him the most.</p>
