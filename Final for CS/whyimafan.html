			<p>Why I'm a Fan</p>
			<div class = "background2">
			<p>The New York Mets have always been my favorite sports team.  I remember watching them almost
				win in 2006.  After that season, they never made the playoffs until 2015.  After years of not seeing
				a winning team, the Mets finally started to show a lot of potential.</p><br/>
			<p>Players such as Matt Harvey, Jacob DeGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Steven Matz, and Zack Wheeler
				are the reason the Mets are a significantly better team.  My favorite is Syndergaard because he is undoubtedly a
				phenomenal pitcher and he is a very charismatic leader.</p><br/>
			<p>Another reason I like Syndergaard is because of his nickname, Thor.  He embraces his nickname because he actually
				looks like the superhero.</p><br/>
			<p>When the Mets traded for Syndergaard, I was not that happy.  We had traded a Cy Young award winning pitcher, R.A. Dickey to the
			Toronto Blue Jays for the young star.  Syndergaard had a lot of potential and today we can all see how this trade had panned out for the
			Mets.  Now, this player is my favorite to watch.</p><br/>
			<p>When the Mets were in the playoffs in 2015, I went to Game 3 of the NLDS against the Dodger with my brother and two of his friends.
			The Mets battled with the Dodgers all night as they pulled ahead late in the game and sealed the deal with a 13-7 win.  Matt Harvey
			was the Mets' pitcher and struggled a little bit but he had also come back from Tommy John surgery and had pitched the most out of any pitcher
			after having this extensive procedure.</p><br/>
