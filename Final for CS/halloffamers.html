				<p>The New York Mets currently have two players in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
				They are Tom Seaver and Mike Piazza</p><br/>
				<p>Tom Seaver leads the Mets in wins, lowest Earned Run Average, strikeouts, and WHIP.
				WHIP is a acronym for walks hits per innings pitched.</p><br/>
				<p>Due to his unbelievable stats, he earned the nicknames "Tom Terrific" and "The Franchise".  He had nine
				consecutive seasons with 200 or more strike outs and he has three Cy Young awards under in belt.</p><br/>
				<p>Mike Piazza is considered the greatest hitting catcher of all time.  He had a career batting
				average of .308.  He has the highest slugging percentage of any Met, and he has the most
				RBIs in a single season.</p><br/>
				<p>Mike Piazza was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame this year.  He, alongside Ken Griffey Jr.,
				received a much earned prize.  Piazza was never drafted by the Mets.  We traded for him in 1998 and it is considered
				one of the best trades in Mets history.  The Mets sent Preston Wilson, Geoff Goetzm and Ed Yarnell to Miami for the future
				Hall of Famer.</p><br/>
